“Azure + Copilot Studio Agent Builder (Step-by-Step, No Drag & Drop)”

Claude, act as my technical system designer for building production-grade AI agents in Azure, using Copilot Studio as the front-end Copilot, but NOT using the slow drag-and-drop UI.

I want a fast, precise, code-driven workflow that outputs everything I need to build agents, their backends, integrations, and RAG components as text, schemas, and configuration, which I will manually add to Copilot Studio.

Your job is to generate:

Step-by-step implementation plan

Code for actions, plugins, and connectors

JSON/YAML for agent definitions

Schemas for tools/actions

RAG wiring (Azure AI Search + Blob)

Azure OpenAI model call patterns

Security considerations (Entra ID, permissions)

Diagram(s) of agent architecture

Testing & evaluation plan

Deployment plan (Dev → Test → Prod)

I am building multiple Copilot Studio agents that rely on:

Azure OpenAI (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Phi-3, o-series)

Azure AI Search (vector + keyword)

Azure Blob for knowledge sources

Custom REST APIs

Azure Functions

Microsoft Graph

MCP servers (optional)

Tool schemas (OpenAPI or JSON Schema)

I want you to produce a repeatable scaffold so I can build any new agent in Copilot Studio using the same blueprint.

🔧 AGENT TYPE(S) TO BUILD

Start with producing a “universal agent blueprint” for:

Research Agent

Searches online sources (arXiv, Bing, internal docs)

Retrieves & ranks passages

Summarizes with citations

Document Intelligence Agent

Uses Azure AI Search

Summarizes docs

Extracts structured data

Task Execution Agent

Dynamic tool calling

Calls REST APIs

Writes to internal systems

Fact-Checker Agent

Verifies claims

Pulls evidence from RAG

Outputs annotated answers

These will be installed into Copilot Studio by pasting your generated content directly into:

Actions

Topics

Agent instructions

Plugins

🧩 OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

Give me everything in clean, ready-to-paste blocks, including:

1. MASTER BLUEPRINT

A complete method for building agents in Azure with Copilot Studio, including:

High-level architecture

Core components

Execution flow

Copilot Studio configuration strategy

2. COPILOT STUDIO INPUTS

Provide explicit paste-ready content:

Agent System Prompt

Agent Behavior Rules

Agent Tool Schemas

Agent Capabilities Definition

Agent Memory (design plan)

Agent Knowledge Sources (RAG plan)

3. AZURE BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION

Paste-ready blocks for:

Azure Function (C# or Python) for tools

OpenAPI definition for each tool

Example JSON schema for Copilot Studio “Actions”

Azure AI Search index definition

Embedding pipeline for knowledge ingestion

4. AGENT CALLING PATTERNS

Provide:

Tool-call JSON

Example RAG invocation

Example orchestration response

5. SECURITY & GOVERNANCE

Include:

Entra ID scopes & permissions

Managed identity setup

Data boundary rules

Logging patterns (App Insights)

Audit logging suggestions

6. DIAGRAMS

Generate at least 2 diagrams:

Overall multi-agent architecture (Azure)

Copilot Studio → Tools → Azure backend flow

Use Mermaid.

7. END-TO-END BUILD CHECKLIST

A concise, ordered checklist so I can reproduce everything quickly.

🎯 STYLE REQUIREMENTS

Be very direct & procedural

Provide copy-ready JSON, YAML, and code

Use Azure-native terminology

Use Copilot Studio-specific vocabulary (Actions, Plugins, Topics, Authoring Canvas)

Avoid unnecessary explanations

No drag-and-drop UI instructions unless absolutely required

Structure everything for speed and automation

▶️ BEGIN NOW

Start by outputting the Master Blueprint, then wait for me to say continue.

Do not skip steps.
Do not summarize.
Deliver full detail.
