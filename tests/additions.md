Key Additions:

Feature Flag Controller (yellow box):

Positioned between User Interface and Clarity Engine
Shows "FastTrack ATO" toggle
ON = Minimal Path (green)
OFF = Full Path (orange)


Template Engine (green box at top):

For FastTrack path only
Pre-approved baselines
Requires only 8 fields
Bypasses Dynamic JSON completely


Two Distinct Paths:

Green Path (FastTrack): User → Feature Flag → Template Engine → Clarity Engine → API Gateway → Archer (direct to ATO)
Orange Path (Traditional): User → Feature Flag → Clarity Engine → Dynamic JSON → Full questioning → API Gateway → Archer


Visual Indicators:

Green arrows and labels for FastTrack path
Orange arrows and labels for Traditional path
Shows "8 Fields" input for FastTrack vs "Full Questions" for Traditional


Path Convergence:

Both paths converge at the API Gateway
FastTrack automatically approves minimum controls
Traditional path requires full validation
