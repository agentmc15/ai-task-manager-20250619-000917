## Section 2 — Very Conservative 12‑Month Timeline

> This plan assumes sequential phases, formal reviews at each gate, and extra slack for approvals, access, and security reviews. If some steps run in parallel, the schedule can be compressed—this version intentionally **pads for risk**.

### Assumptions
- Dedicated team: PM, ML/RAG engineer, backend engineer, MLOps, UX, part‑time domain SME, QA.  
- Access to IRAMP APIs or integration points exists but may require approvals.  
- Source corpus spans multiple repositories and needs cleansing/governance.  
- Security, privacy, and change‑management reviews are required before pilot and before production.

### Timeline at a Glance (12 months)

| Month | Phase (exit criteria) | Primary outputs |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** | **Requirements & Planning** (signed scope, success metrics) | Requirements spec, RACI, risk log, schedule baseline |
| **M2–M3** | **Data Collection & Curation** (approved v1 corpus + labels) | Curated/cleaned corpus, chunking/metadata strategy, governance rules |
| **M3** | **Architecture & Environment Setup** (dev/stage envs live) | RAG stack skeleton, CI/CD, vector DB, observability hooks |
| **M4** | **Baseline RAG Prototype** (answers top‑3 recall ≥60% on eval set) | Working prototype, evaluation harness, initial prompts |
| **M5–M6** | **Model Tuning & Retrieval Optimization** (recall@5 ≥80%, SME accuracy ≥70%) | Prompting/playbooks, reranking, grounding strategy, guardrails |
| **M6–M7** | **Integration with IRAMP** (stable APIs, P95 latency target met in stage) | AuthN/Z, audit logging, E2E flows, error handling |
| **M7–M8** | **UX Design & Build** (design review sign‑off, accessibility check) | High‑fi UI, conversation logging & feedback UI |
| **M8** | **Security/Privacy Review** (findings remediated) | Threat model, DPIA/PIA, red‑team results & fixes |
| **M9** | **System Testing & UAT** (SME acceptance ≥80% helpful/accurate) | Test report, performance & load results, bug burn‑down |
| **M10** | **Pilot Deployment** (pilot SLOs met for 30 days) | Pilot release, usage analytics, pilot retrospective |
| **M11** | **Iteration & Hardening** (SME accuracy ≥85%, hallucination rate ↓) | Dataset expansion, model/UX refinements, reliability work |
| **M12** | **Production Rollout & Training** (change‑advisory approval) | GA release, playbooks/runbooks, training assets, hypercare |

> The plan embeds ~20–25% schedule buffer within phases to absorb delays in access, approvals, or integration.
